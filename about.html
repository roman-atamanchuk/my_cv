        <h2>Roman Atamanchuk</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is <strong>Roman Atamanchuk</strong>, originally from
          Ukraine. Currently, I am based in Waterford, Ireland, where I am
          pursuing a degree in Computer Science at SETU University. My path has
          been both dynamic and enriching, blending my passion for technology,
          active living, and continuous learning.
        </p>

        <h3>Background & Studies</h3>
        <p>
          I was born in 1979 and have long been fascinated by the power of
          technology to shape our lives. This interest led me to pursue a formal
          education in Computer Science at SETU University, where I am
          developing skills in programming, problem-solving, and emerging
          technologies.
        </p>

        <h3>My Values & Passions</h3>
        <p>
          Lifelong learning and staying active are essential to me, both
          mentally and physically. I enjoy challenging myself in various areas,
          whether in coding projects or physical activities like jogging and
          swimming. Balancing these activities keeps me energized and motivated
          to continually grow.
        </p>

        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <p>
          My goal is to continue developing as a tech professional and explore
          fields like software engineering and data science. I aim to contribute
          to meaningful projects that solve real-world problems and create a
          positive impact in the technology sector.
